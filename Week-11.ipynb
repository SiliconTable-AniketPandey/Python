    "    If exceptions occur within a finally block in Python, the behavior can affect how the program handles errors and executes cleanup operations. \n",
    "    Here's a detailed explanation of what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose of finally Block:\n",
    "        The finally block in Python is used to define clean-up actions that must be executed under all circumstances, whether an exception occurs or not. \n",
    "        It is typically used to release external resources (like files or network connections) regardless of whether the code block inside the try block raised an exception or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Execution Flow:\n",
    "        When an exception occurs within the try block, Python checks if there is a finally block associated with it. \n",
    "        If present, Python first executes the code inside the finally block before propagating the exception up the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Handling Exceptions in finally:\n",
    "        If an exception occurs within the finally block itself:\n",
    "            If this exception is not caught within the finally block, it will propagate outward.\n",
    "            The original exception raised in the try block (if any) will be temporarily suspended while Python processes the new exception from the finally block.\n",
    "            Once the finally block completes (or an exception occurs within it), Python resumes the handling of the original exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Exception Propagation:\n",
    "        If an exception occurs within the finally block and it is not caught within that block, the exception will propagate upward in the call stack.\n",
    "        If the original exception from the try block is still being handled (i.e., has not been caught yet), the new exception from the finally block will take precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Uncaught Exceptions:\n",
    "        If an exception occurs in the finally block and it is not caught within that block, Python will continue to propagate the exception to the calling context \n",
    "        (and potentially further up the stack) until it is handled by an appropriate except block or reaches the top level (causing the program to terminate).\n",
