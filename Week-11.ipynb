    "    If exceptions occurs within a finally block in Python, the behavior can affect how the program handles errors and executes cleanup operations. \n",
    "    Here's a detailed explanation of what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose of finally Block:\n",
    "        The finally block in Python is used to define clean-up actions that must be executed under all circumstances, whether an exception occurs or not. \n",
    "        It is typically used to release external resources (like files or network connections) regardless of whether the code block inside the try block raised an exception or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Execution Flow:\n",
    "        When an exception occurs within the try block, Python checks if there is a finally block associated with it. \n",
    "        If present, Python first executes the code inside the finally block before propagating the exception up the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Handling Exceptions in finally:\n",
    "        If an exception occurs within the finally block itself:\n",
    "            If this exception is not caught within the finally block, it will propagate outward.\n",
    "            The original exception raised in the try block (if any) will be temporarily suspended while Python processes the new exception from the finally block.\n",
    "            Once the finally block completes (or an exception occurs within it), Python resumes the handling of the original exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Exception Propagation:\n",
    "        If an exception occurs within the finally block and it is not caught within that block, the exception will propagate upward in the call stack.\n",
    "        If the original exception from the try block is still being handled (i.e., has not been caught yet), the new exception from the finally block will take precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Uncaught Exceptions:\n",
    "        If an exception occurs in the finally block and it is not caught within that block, Python will continue to propagate the exception to the calling context \n",
    "        (and potentially further up the stack) until it is handled by an appropriate except block or reaches the top level (causing the program to terminate).\n",

    "    Iterators are essential in Python for enabling efficient and flexible traversal of data structures, particularly for objects that are iterable (i.e., capable of returning elements one at a time). \n",
    "    Understanding iterators is fundamental to working with loops, comprehensions, and other iterable-based operations in Python. Here's why iterators are useful and how they are used:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    What is an Iterator?\n",
    "\n",
    "    An iterator in Python is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "        __iter__(): This method returns the iterator object itself. It is called when the iterator is required (e.g., by a for loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "        __next__(): This method returns the next item from the iterator. It raises a StopIteration exception when there are no more items to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Benefits of Iterators:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Lazy Evaluation:\n",
    "            Iterators allow for lazy evaluation of elements, meaning that they produce elements on-the-fly as requested, rather than computing or storing all elements in advance.\n",
    "            This is particularly useful when dealing with large or infinite sequences (e.g., generating Fibonacci numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "            Since iterators compute elements on demand, they can be more memory-efficient compared to storing all elements of a sequence in memory at once.\n",
    "            This is advantageous when dealing with large datasets or when memory usage is a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Support for Iteration Protocols:\n",
    "            Iterators can be used with various Python constructs that expect iterables, such as for loops, list comprehensions, generator expressions, and other iterable-based operations.\n",
    "            This makes iterators versatile and compatible with many built-in functions and language features.\n",
    "\n",
