# Introduction to Python

This repository contains python codes written in jupyter notebooks. I have written this notebook to help students learn Python efficiently, focusing on practicality and knowledge and not collage attendance (85% in my case) which most of us (students) hate.

In this notebook or a series of notebooks covered in almost 13 weeks I have demonstrated use of core Python along with OPPs concepts and some more advanced concepts, emphasizing on beginner-friendly without compromising on quality code along with tons of comments and in-notebook documentation to help you along the code.

Library such as Pandas Matplotlib and NumPy are also covered.

All my fiends are requested to not just go and copy the code, but to actually practice questions. Yes, some good questions are also included in the notebook along with the solution code.
